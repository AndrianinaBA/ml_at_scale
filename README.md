# ml_at_scale
ML at scale course, Recommender system by Alternating Least Squares

## What it is about?
This repositories is made as part of the report on the Course Machine Learning at Scale at African Institute for Mathematcial Sciences under the insightful teaching and guidance of Ulrich Paquet.
It contains all the codes and implementations for the Alternating Least Squares algorithm to do prediction of user preference on the MovieLens datasets.

## What is in the repositories?
In this repositories we have all the codes as well as the main report (the draft and the definitive). The codes are agenced as follows :
- Python files : Contains all the helper function and all the codes to process, split the data and the updates of the users, movies and features update necessary for the main loop to train the model.
- Notebook files : main.ipynb is the core of the repositories. It contains the implementation and all the codes needed to do the report.

## How to run?
- Install the necessary library such as numpy, numba, matplotlib in order to run the codes.
- Download the datasets at [MovieLens32M](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-32m.zip).
- Put `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` in the same folder as the repositories.    
- Run through all the cells of main.ipynb and (un)comment what is relevant for the current run 😁
